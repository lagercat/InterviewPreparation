# InterviewPreparation
My solutions to various interview questions found on the internet &amp; in different books.

Note that these solutions are not meant to represent proper Java Code (there is no encapsulation for instance). But rather, they
are the kind of code I would write in an actual interview which tends to be very tight on time. Normally these would come with 
various verbal explanations on why I don't bother with some of these details now so that the interviewer is aware that I am aware
of the way good OOP code is written.
